# Project: Skills Category in the Library

## Goal

Introduce the skills category to the start-cli library: the schema, the agent
skill-path attribute, the index extension, and a first published skill module. This is
the library half of the skills feature; the start CLI consumes it via the CUE Central
Registry.

## Scope

In scope:

- A `#Skill` schema.
- A `skills` attribute on the `#Agent` schema.
- A `skills` map on the `#Index` schema.
- One example skill module: `skills/workflows/one-by-one`.
- The `skills` attribute populated on the claude agent variants.
- Registration of the new skill in `index/index.cue`.
- Extension of the index validator to vet skills entries.
- Publishing of the new and changed modules and the index.

Out of scope:

- Any start CLI code. The CLI work is separate projects that consume these published
  modules.
- The agy (Google Antigravity CLI) agent module. agy is the agent that reads
  `~/.agents/skills`, and authoring it requires Antigravity CLI specifics. It is its own
  project (`library/02-agy-agent.md`). Claude's `skills` attribute, delivered here, is
  sufficient to exercise the feature end to end without agy.
- `skills` attributes for gemini, copilot, and aichat. Add them when each tool's skill
  directory paths are confirmed.

## Current State

- The library is a CUE-only repository published to the CUE Central Registry as
  `github.com/start-cli/library`. Each module is a directory with a `*.cue` definition,
  a `cue.mod/module.cue`, and optional markdown, importing
  `github.com/start-cli/library/schemas@v1`.
- `schemas/` holds base, utd, agent, role, context, task, index, and settings schemas.
  `#Base` provides description, tags, origin, and uses. `#UTD` provides file, command,
  prompt, shell, timeout. Roles, contexts, and tasks embed both; agents do not embed
  `#UTD`.
- `#Agent` currently carries command, bin, default_model, and models. A claude variant
  looks like:

  ```cue
  agent: schemas.#Agent & {
  	bin:         "claude"
  	command:     "{{.bin}} --model {{.model}} ... {{.prompt}}"
  	description: "..."
  	default_model: "sonnet"
  	models: {haiku: "haiku", sonnet: "sonnet", opus: "opus"}
  	tags: [...]
  }
  ```

- `agents/` contains claude, gemini, copilot, and aichat, each with interactive, edit,
  bypass-permissions, non-interactive, and unattended variants. agy is absent.
- `#Index` has agents, roles, contexts, and tasks maps of `#IndexEntry`
  (module, description, tags, version, optional bin). `index/index.cue` holds the
  published entries.
- `scripts/validate-index` runs `cue vet` on the index and asserts the non-TTY
  default-resolution contract for agents in pure CUE.
- The publishing procedure is owned by the task `start get contexts:start/library/publishing`:
  validation, version determination, tag preflight, mandatory index update, a single
  module-plus-index commit, tag pushes, registry publish, verification.

  Read it first; this project implements its library half.

  follow.
- `library/AGENTS.md` — module patterns, address scheme, validation and publishing
  commands.

## Requirements

1. A `schemas/skill.cue` defining `#Skill` as `#Base` plus an entry pointer
   `file: string | *"@module/SKILL.md"`. It must not embed `#UTD`.
2. `#Agent` extended with an optional `skills` attribute carrying a `global` and a
   `local` path string. An agent that omits it is not a skill target.
3. `#Index` extended with an optional `skills` map of `#IndexEntry`, consistent with the
   other category maps.
4. An example skill module at `skills/workflows/one-by-one`. Its directory name is the
   leaf `one-by-one`. It contains a `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter has `name: one-by-one`
   and a description, a `skill.cue` providing the library metadata, and a
   `cue.mod/module.cue`. The SKILL.md body provides a usable skill; it should mirror the
   one-by-one remediation workflow (walk a list of findings one at a time, resolve each
   with a principled fix).
5. The claude agent variants declare `skills: {global: "~/.claude/skills", local: ".claude/skills"}`.
6. `index/index.cue` registers the skill under the `skills` map keyed `workflows/one-by-one`,
   with module path, version, description, and tags.
7. `scripts/validate-index` extended to vet the `skills` map against `#IndexEntry`. The
   non-TTY agent contract is unchanged and does not apply to skills.
8. All new and changed modules and the index published to the registry and resolvable.

## Constraints

- Every `cue.mod/module.cue` pins the CUE language version used across the library
  (v0.16.0) and depends on `schemas@v1`.
- Import schemas from `github.com/start-cli/library/schemas@v1`. Package names match the
  deepest directory segment with hyphens removed.
- SKILL.md follows the Agent Skills specification, not the library agent-doc markdown
  rules. Its `name` must equal the parent directory name and satisfy the spec's name and
  description constraints.
- skill.cue comments and any authored library docs follow the library agent-doc markdown
  conventions.
- Commits use scoped commit format. A module change and its index entry land in one
  commit. Versioning follows SemVer; a new module starts at its initial published
  version.
- The schema change to `#Agent` and `#Index` is additive and optional, so it must not
  break existing modules or require their republishing beyond the schema module itself.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `schemas/skill.cue`. Extend `schemas/agent.cue` with the optional `skills`
   attribute and `schemas/index.cue` with the optional `skills` map.
2. Validate the schemas with `cue vet`, adding a skill example under `docs/examples`
   consistent with the existing example-and-vet pattern.
3. Author the `skills/workflows/one-by-one` module: SKILL.md, skill.cue, cue.mod. Run
   `cue mod tidy` and `cue vet ./...` in the module.
4. Validate the SKILL.md frontmatter against the Agent Skills rules (name equals
   directory, character set, description length).
5. Add the `skills` attribute to each claude agent variant.
6. Register the skill in `index/index.cue` and extend `scripts/validate-index` to vet the
   skills map. Run the validator.
7. Publish using the publishing task. Publish the schema module first since the example
   skill depends on it, then the skill module and the index.

## Implementation Guidance

- The example skill is the reference other skills will be modelled on, so keep its
  layout clean and its frontmatter exemplary. Demonstrating an optional resource
  directory (for example a `references/` file) is welcome but not required.
- agy is handled by its own project (`library/02-agy-agent.md`). The schema change here
  is what unblocks it: ensure the `#Agent.skills` attribute is optional so existing
  agents that omit it remain valid.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `cue vet` passes for the skill schema and its example, and for the extended agent and
  index schemas.
- `scripts/validate-index` passes with the skills map present.
- The `skills/workflows/one-by-one` module builds (`cue vet ./...`) and its SKILL.md
  satisfies the Agent Skills frontmatter rules with `name` equal to the directory name.
- Each claude agent variant carries `skills.global` and `skills.local`.
- `index/index.cue` contains the `workflows/one-by-one` skills entry.
- The schema, skill, and index changes are published and resolvable from the registry.

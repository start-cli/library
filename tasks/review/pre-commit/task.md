# Pre-commit Code Review

Interactive review of code changes from git diff output. Finds issues, walks through each one, and fixes them before commit.

This is not a general-purpose repository review. The diff output is the guide — only review the changed code and its immediate context.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Review

1. Run git status to confirm we are in a Git repository and determine the state of changes (staged, unstaged, or both)
2. Determine the appropriate diff command:
   - `git diff` for unstaged only
   - `git diff --staged` for staged only
   - `git diff HEAD` for both
   - `git diff <default>..HEAD` for changes since a branch point
   - Follow user instructions if provided
3. Run the diff command and read the output to understand the scope and intent of the changes
4. For each changed file, read the full file and related files to understand surrounding context
5. Review the changes against all criteria below
6. Produce a structured report of findings and present it inline. No disk writes
7. If there are no actionable findings, skip to Phase 4 and report no issues found. Otherwise display the Top-level Prompt (see Commands)

### Phase 2: Remediation

Apply safe items immediately, without prompting. Safe items are anything that does not touch application code:

- Tests — add, remove, or change
- Comments — add, remove, or change
- Documentation — add, remove, or change

State what was applied for each safe item. Safe items do not count toward `T`.

Let `T` be the count of remaining actionable findings — the critical, high, medium, and low items, excluding info items (recorded only) and the safe items applied above. The top-level choice from Phase 1 selects how they are handled: `C` walks them one at a time in severity order, `A` applies the recommended resolution to every finding automatically. Letters are case-insensitive.

Continue (`C`) walks the findings one at a time in severity order. For each finding:

1. Re-read the target code and related code carefully, then critically re-evaluate the recommendation. The original finding may have been wrong, or rendered obsolete by an earlier fix. If the recommendation no longer holds, say so and revise or withdraw it before presenting.
2. Present the finding using the Per-item Template (below) with `n` as the position in the walk and `T` as the total. `T` excludes safe items and info items.
3. Display the Per-item Prompt (see Commands) and pause for an explicit decision. Never assume blanket approval from an earlier response. Accepting one finding does not authorise the next. If a response is ambiguous, ask which finding it applies to.

Per-item command semantics. Letters are case-insensitive. Outcomes are tracked in-session — they are not written to disk at the moment of decision. They surface in the Phase 4 summary table and in the Remediation Summary if the review is saved.

- An option letter (`A`, `B`, `C` …) — apply that specific option. Track as `Fixed`. Briefly confirm what was done.
- `R` — apply exactly what the Recommendation states, which may be a single option, a combination, or a blend. Otherwise identical to applying an option. Track as `Fixed`.
- `N` — acknowledge and move to the next finding. Track as `Skipped`.
- `P` — spin the finding out as a standalone follow-up file (see Project File Format below). Track as `Project: <filename>`. Move to the next finding without offering an inline resolution.
- `S` — see Save (below).

All (`A`) applies recommendations automatically. Work through the `T` findings in severity order without displaying the Per-item Prompt. For each finding:

1. Announce `(n of T) <ID> <short title>`.
2. Re-read the target code and related code and critically re-evaluate the recommendation, as in the walk. If it no longer holds, say so and skip it, tracking as `Skipped`.
3. Apply the recommended resolution — identical to `R` — and briefly confirm what was done. Track as `Fixed`.

The edit is the checkpoint. If you deny an edit, stop and discuss that finding; once it is resolved, resume the run for the remaining findings or switch to the one-at-a-time walk.

Remediation guidance:

- Bias recommendations toward the principled long-term solution that reduces maintenance and improves quality. Do not default to the smallest-diff resolution
- Apply minimal, targeted edits to integrate the resolution. Refactor surrounding code only when required to make the resolution land cleanly
- If a resolution would be too large or risky to apply inline, recommend `P` to spin it out rather than attempting it inline
- Keep each fix focused on the issue being addressed and related code

### Phase 3: Satisfaction Pass

After all findings have been processed, do a focused re-check on only the code that was modified by fixes during Phase 2.

- Only examine the lines and immediate context touched by fixes, not a full re-review
- Handle new findings using the mode chosen at the top level — walk them under `C`, auto-apply them under `A` (deny an edit to discuss)
- This pass is lightweight — catch regressions introduced by the fixes themselves
- After fixes are applied, run any formatters or linters the project has configured on the touched files and address any new violations they surface

### Phase 4: Wrap-up

1. Print a summary table of all findings and their outcomes
2. Prompt the user once: enter `S` to write the final report. Any other reply skips the save
3. Remind the user to review the changes before committing

## Reviewer Guidance

- The diff is your primary input — stay focused on what changed
- Read surrounding code in changed files to understand context
- Distinguish between new issues introduced by the diff and pre-existing issues
- Flag pre-existing issues if discovered
- Ask clarifying questions when the intent of a change is unclear
- Reference the specific file and change from the diff in each finding
- Recommendations target the principled long-term solution. Do not default to the minimal-diff resolution
- Classify findings by severity (critical, high, medium, low, info):
  - Not every review category will produce findings at every severity level
  - Use the levels that fit rather than forcing findings into categories that do not apply
- Give each finding an ID: its severity letter (`C`, `H`, `M`, `L`, `I`) plus a per-severity number — `C1`, `H1`, `H2`, `M1`, `L1`, `I1`. The ID carries the severity, so severity is not repeated as a separate column or field
- Findings about multiple unrelated changes within a single commit are classified as `info`
- The Findings table lists only severities that have findings; the count line summarises the totals across all severities
- It is acceptable to find no issues. If the changes are well-implemented, say so. Do not manufacture findings to justify the review

## Per-item Template

This template is a suggestion. Keep details succinct; expand only when the finding genuinely warrants it.

```
### Issue n of T — <ID>: <short title>

Category: <e.g. Security, Correctness>
Location: <file:line>

Issue
<what the issue is and why it matters in context>

Options
A. <option>
B. <option>
C. <option>

Recommendation (B): <which option, with a brief why focused on the principled long-term solution>
```

Display the Per-item Prompt (see Commands) immediately after presenting the finding.

Include an Options block only when alternatives clarify the choice — otherwise omit it and lead with a single Recommendation that `R` accepts. When present, label options from `A`. The Recommendation names the option letter or letters it favours, and may combine options (for example `Recommendation (B + C)`).

## Report Format

Structure the review report as follows:

```
## Diff Review Summary

Scope: <number of files changed, insertions, deletions>
Intent: <brief description of what the changes accomplish>
Findings: <count per severity, e.g. 2 critical, 1 high, 3 medium, 1 low, 4 info>

## Findings

A complete list of every finding in severity order — list all of them, do not truncate. Info items are recorded for awareness only and are not walked. The detail for each actionable finding (Issue, Options, Recommendation) is presented one at a time during the Phase 2 walk, not here.

| ID | Category | Location | Finding |
|----|----------|----------|---------|
| C1 | Security | src/auth.go:88 | <one-line summary> |
| M1 | Readability | src/foo.go:42 | <one-line summary> |
| I1 | Duplication | src/bar.go:10 | <one-line summary> |

## Assessment

<overall assessment of the changes, noting both strengths and weaknesses>
```

When the report is saved after remediation begins, append the following section. Outcome values are:

- `Fixed` — the change was applied
- `Skipped` — the finding was acknowledged with `N` and left unresolved
- `Project: <filename>` — spun out as a standalone follow-up (see Project File Format below)
- `Pending` — `S` was invoked before the finding had been processed

```
## Remediation Summary

| ID | Finding | Outcome |
|----|---------|---------|
| C1 | Brief description | Fixed |
| H1 | Brief description | Skipped |
| M1 | Brief description | Project: 01-race-condition-in-token-refresh.md |
| L1 | Brief description | Pending |
```

## Project File Format

When `P` is selected during remediation, write a standalone file at the repository root named `NN-<slug>.md` where:

- `NN` starts at `01` and increments based on existing files matching the pattern
- `<title>` is the `<short title>` value from the presentation template used during remediation
- `<slug>` is `<title>` lowercased and hyphenated (e.g. "Race condition in token refresh" becomes `race-condition-in-token-refresh`)

The file must be fully self-contained so a new AI agent session can pick it up with no extra context. Include only the sections below that apply — right-size the document to the scope of the finding.

```
# <title>

Source: pre-commit review on YYYY-MM-DD
Severity: <critical | high | medium | low>
Category: <e.g. Security, Correctness>
Location: <file:line>

## Goal

One to three sentences on what is being built or changed and why. Focus on outcome and motivation, not tasks.

## Scope

What is in scope; what is explicitly out of scope.

## Current State

Relevant existing state — files, configuration, and the finding itself — enough that the implementer can read the requirements with understanding.

## Requirements

Numbered, clear, verifiable deliverables. State what must be produced, not how.

## Implementation Plan

Ordered steps at a level that gives direction without prescribing code. Snippets are acceptable to clarify non-obvious integration. Omit if the requirements are self-explanatory.

## Constraints

Hard rules: language version, target platforms, required tooling, compatibility requirements. Items that cannot be violated without breaking the project.

## Acceptance Criteria

Observable, verifiable outcomes that signal completion. Project-specific only — do not list universals like "build passes" or "tests pass".
```

Writing guidelines:

- Define outcomes and constraints, not keystrokes. The implementing agent owns implementation details
- Be explicit and complete — do not reference the conversation that produced the finding
- Code snippets are acceptable for clarification; full implementations are not
- Use direct language: "do X", not "consider doing X"

## Save

When `S` is invoked at any phase:

1. Discover the next available filename: `.start/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-pre-commit-NN.md` where `YYYY-MM-DD` is today's date and `NN` starts at `01`, incrementing based on existing files matching the date and slug
2. Write the current report. If remediation has started, include the Remediation Summary section with current outcomes. Findings not yet processed are recorded as `Pending`
3. Confirm the filename written

# Architecture Review

Evaluate the system's structure, design decisions, and component organisation. This review focuses on how the system is divided, how its parts interact, and whether the design supports stability and growth. It does not cover security vulnerabilities, code correctness, or performance characteristics unless they are a direct consequence of architectural decisions.

## Prerequisites

- A repository with source code to review
- Access to read all files in the repository

## Workflow

1. Read top-level documentation (README, AGENTS.md, design docs, configuration files) to understand the system's purpose and intended architecture
2. Map the high-level structure: packages, modules, layers, and their relationships
3. Trace dependency flow between components to identify coupling and boundary violations
4. Read API surfaces, interfaces, and contracts between modules
5. Review configuration management, database schemas, and migration patterns
6. Evaluate the scope points below against what you have observed
7. Produce a structured report of findings
8. Unless instructed otherwise, save the report to `.start/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-architecture-NN.md`
   - Use today's date for `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Increment `NN` based on existing files in `.start/reviews/` matching the date and type, starting at `01`

## Reviewer Guidance

- Evaluate architecture relative to the system's scale and purpose. A small CLI tool does not need the same layering as a distributed service. Judge the design against what it needs to be, not an idealised reference architecture.
- Severity should reflect structural risk. A circular dependency between core modules that prevents independent change is critical. A slightly unclear boundary in a stable, rarely modified area is low. Consider how much the flaw constrains future development or introduces fragility.
- Distinguish between intentional trade-offs and accidental complexity. Not every shortcut is a defect. If the design deviates from a textbook pattern but the trade-off is reasonable for the context, note it as an observation rather than a finding.
- It is acceptable to find no issues. A well-structured system with clear boundaries is a valid outcome. Do not manufacture findings or flag pragmatic design choices as architectural defects to justify the review.
- Write "None" for any severity level where no findings exist. Every section must be present in the report.

## Scope

- System Design and Layering: Ensuring clear separation of concerns where each layer has a distinct responsibility and avoids leaky abstractions.
- Component Boundaries: Verifying that interactions between modules are well-defined and do not violate the principle of least knowledge.
- Dependency Flow: Assessing the direction of dependencies to ensure high-level policy is protected from implementation details.
- Modularity and Reusability: Identifying opportunities for abstraction that reduce coupling while avoiding premature generalization.
- API Design and Contracts: Evaluating the stability and clarity of interfaces to ensure they are difficult to misuse.
- Backwards Compatibility: Ensuring changes do not break existing integrations, data formats, or downstream expectations.
- Configuration Management: Verifying that system behavior can be adjusted safely through structured configuration without code changes.
- Rollout Strategy: Reviewing how features are exposed to allow for safe deployment and incremental validation.
- Scalability and Extensibility: Assessing if the design accommodates growth in data volume or future requirements without requiring a rewrite.
- Database Integrity: Verifying that schema changes maintain data consistency and handle migrations safely.

## Report Format

```
## Architecture Review Summary

Scope: {what was reviewed, number of files}
Findings: {count per severity, e.g. 2 critical, 1 high, 3 medium, 1 low}

## Critical Findings

{findings that represent serious risk or deficiency, or "None"}

## High Findings

{findings that should be addressed, or "None"}

## Medium Findings

{findings worth considering, or "None"}

## Low / Info

{minor observations and suggestions, or "None"}

## Assessment

{overall assessment of the system's architecture, noting both strengths and weaknesses}
```

# Contexts

Context definitions providing environmental information for AI agents.

Each subdirectory contains a CUE package defining a context with structured data about the working environment. Contexts inject relevant information into prompts based on selection behaviour.

## Structure

```
contexts/<scope>/<name>/
├── context.cue
└── cue.mod/module.cue
```

## Selection Behaviour

- `required: true` - Always included in every command
- `default: true` - Included in plain `start`, excluded with explicit `--context`
- `tags` - Included when the matching tag is requested via `--context`

## Available Contexts
